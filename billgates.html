    <h1>BILL GATES</h1>

    < id="HOME">
        <p>Bill Gates, in full William Henry Gates III, (born October 28, 1955, Seattle, Washington, U.S.), American
            computer programmer and entrepreneur who cofounded Microsoft Corporation, the world’s largest personal-computer
            software company.Gates wrote his first software program at the age of 13. In high school he helped form a group
            of programmers who computerized their school’s payroll system and founded Traf-O-Data, a company that sold
            traffic-counting systems to local governments. In 1975 Gates, then a sophomore at Harvard University, joined his
            hometown friend Paul G. Allen to develop software for the first microcomputers. They began by adapting BASIC, a
            popular programming language used on large computers, for use on microcomputers. With the success of this
            project, Gates left Harvard during his junior year and, with Allen, formed Microsoft. Gates’s sway over the
            infant microcomputer industry greatly increased when Microsoft licensed an operating system called MS-DOS to
            International Business Machines Corporation—then the world’s biggest computer supplier and industry
            pacesetter—for use on its first microcomputer, the IBM PC(personal computer). After the machine’s release in
            1981, IBM quickly set the technical standard for the PC industry, and MS-DOS likewise pushed out competing
            operating systems. While Microsoft’s independence strained relations with IBM, Gates deftly manipulated the
            larger company so that it became permanently dependent on him for crucial software. Makers of IBM-compatible
            PCs, or clones, also turned to Microsoft for their basic software. By the start of the 1990s he had become the
            PC industry’s ultimate kingmaker.</p>
        <H2>His Works</H2>
        <p>In addition to his work at Microsoft, Gates was also known for his charitable work. With his then wife, Melinda,
            he launched the William H. Gates Foundation (renamed the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 1999) in 1994 to
            fund global health programs as well as projects in the Pacific Northwest. During the latter part of the 1990s,
            the couple also funded North American libraries through the Gates Library Foundation (renamed Gates Learning
            Foundation in 1999) and raised money for minority study grants through the Gates Millennium Scholars program. In
            June 2006 Warren Buffett announced an ongoing gift to the foundation, which would allow its assets to total
            roughly $60 billion in the next 20 years. At the beginning of the 21st century, the foundation continued to
            focus on global health and global development, as well as community and education causes in the United States.
            After a short transition period, Gates relinquished day-to-day oversight of Microsoft in June 2008—although he
            remained chairman of the board—in order to devote more time to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In February
            2014 he stepped down as chairman but continued to serve as a board member until 2020. During this time he was
            awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2016). The documentary series Inside Bill’s Brain: Decoding Bill
            Gates appeared in 2019. Two years later Gates and his wife divorced.

            ONE GOOD FACT
            The huddle used in American football was invented by the quarterback of a deaf team so that the other team
            wouldn’t be able to see their signals.

            It remains to be seen whether Gates’s extraordinary success will guarantee him a lasting place in the pantheon
            of great Americans. At the very least, historians seem likely to view him as a business figure as important to
            computers as John D. Rockefeller was to oil. Gates himself displayed an acute awareness of the perils of
            prosperity in his 1995 best seller, The Road Ahead, where he observed, “Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces
            smart people into thinking they can’t lose.”
